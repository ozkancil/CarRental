Mapping Between DTOs and Entities:
DTOs are often used to transfer data between layers,
 especially between the Controller and Service layers.
 Mapping between DTOs and entities is typically done using Mapper classes, as we discussed earlier.
 These Mapper classes convert data from DTOs to entities and vice versa, ensuring that the right data is sent
 to the database and returned to the client.



Response:
Once the data has been processed, the appropriate response is generated.
 This response can be in various formats, such as JSON or XML, and it's sent back to the client.
