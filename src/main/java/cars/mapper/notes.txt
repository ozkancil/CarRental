    Above we are telling @Mapper to map the request from the client using the entity contactmessage to map the json format into the database
    using java object.
Mapping between DTOs and entities is typically done using Mapper classes, as we discussed earlier. These Mapper classes convert
 data from DTOs to entities and vice versa, ensuring that the right data is sent to the database and returned to the client.
